                    <div class="line-1"></div>
                    <p>I am currently studying computer and software engineering at the University of Rwanda,<br>
                         with a focus on systems engineering and artificial intelligence.<br>
                        I am proficient in languages such as Java and C++, and have experience working on projects <br>
                        related to these fields. My interests include designing and implementing complex computer systems,<br>
                         as well as developing intelligent systems that can simulate human intelligence.<br>
                        Through my studies and experiences, I have gained expertise in problem-solving,<br>
                        critical thinking, and team collaboration, and I am eager to continue learning and <br>
                        growing as a professional in these fields
                    </p>
                    <h2><b>2019</b> COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
                    <div class="line-1"></div>
                    <p>During high school, I had the opportunity to study computer science,<br>
                      which sparked my passion for technology and problem-solving.<br> I learned a wide range of skills, including coding, algorithms, and data structures, <br>
                      that have prepared me well for further studies or a career in the field.<br>
                       I also developed the ability to think logically and approach complex problems in a systematic way,<br>
                        which are essential skills for success in computer science. 
                    </p>

                    <div class="line-1"></div>
                    <p>I wrote my first line of code in C++ in a school lab,<br>
                     creating a program that displayed my name using a loop and stars.<br>
                    It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and <br>
                    it sparked my passion for programming and computer science.</p>
