        <h1>i made terminal website</h1>
        <p>
            I always loved the sleek and functional design of terminal interfaces, so I decided to create a website that would mimic their look and feel. I knew that this would be a challenging project, but I was determined to see it through.

To get started, I had to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I practiced building simple web pages and styling them with different fonts, colors, and layouts.

Next, I turned my attention to JavaScript. I learned about variables, functions, and control structures, and practiced writing small programs that would run in my web browser.

With my newfound skills, I started building the skeleton of my terminal website. I used HTML to create the basic structure of the page, and added CSS to style it with a dark, monochrome color scheme that evoked the look of a terminal. I also used JavaScript to create interactive elements like buttons and input fields that would allow users to enter commands and receive output.

As I worked on the website, I encountered a few challenges. I had to debug my JavaScript code to fix any errors. But with perseverance and a bit of help from online resources, I was able to overcome these challenges and build a functional terminal website.

Finally, after many long hours of work, my terminal website was complete. I launched it online, and it quickly gained a loyal following of users who enjoyed the immersive terminal experience that I had created. I was proud of the website that I had built, and I knew that I had learned valuable skills that would serve me well in my future web development endeavors.
